STARTUP PROCEDURE

Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Install all required packages using the requirements file.
Run this command in a terminal from inside the project folder:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure your project directory contains the following files:
server.py
index.html
.env
requirements.txt
history/ (this will be created automatically)

Confirm your .env file contains your API key in the following format:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Start the backend server.
Run this command from inside the project folder:
uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000
If uvicorn is not recognized, use:
python -m uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000

Start the frontend.
Run this command:
python -m http.server 3000
Then open the following URL in a browser:
http://localhost:3000/index.html

Use the application.
Send a message through the interface.
The backend will stream a response.
Chats are saved automatically once enough context is provided.

To stop the application, close the terminal windows running uvicorn and the HTTP server.
