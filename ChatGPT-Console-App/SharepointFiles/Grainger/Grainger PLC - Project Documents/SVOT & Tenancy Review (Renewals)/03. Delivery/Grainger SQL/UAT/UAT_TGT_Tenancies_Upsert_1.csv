Further to Section B, Clauses 5 and 6 of this Agreement it is further agreed that Mr Bradley Cole shall pay a shortfall of £400.00 rent in advance as detailed in the Initial Statement of Monies in order to pass referencing. This means that the tenant(s) will then be expected to pay a total of £744.00 rent per calendar month for the remainder of the full 11 monthly payments in contractual term of their tenancy (the deduction has not been applied to the apportionments at the beginning and end of the tenancy, therefore £400 has been divided by 11). At the end of this tenancy should the tenant(s) seek a New Agreement, and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to undergo further referencing to determine whether they are required to make any advance payment of rent for the new term. In either case the tenant(s) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents’ instructions with regard to payment and n to make such payment promptly and in line with the provisions of this Agreement.",,,

We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

11.1	Smoking

You, your family, guests and visitors must not smoke any substance or use electronic cigarettes inside or in the vicinity of the premises or the building, including on any balcony or in any communal spaces and in the event that damage is caused to the premises or the building as a result of a breach of this clause of the agreement, you agree to pay the costs incurred by us, in repairing that damage or redecorating the premises or building or have a sum equal to those costs deducted from the deposit

11.2	LW Water Re-Charge

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Thames Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly installments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Thames Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Thames Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property

11.3 Tenant Break Clause

The Landlord agrees that the Tenant has the right to terminate the Tenancy giving the Landlord not less than TWO (2) months PRIOR notice in writing. For the avoidance of doubt between the parties it is agreed that the notice period must expire on the last day of a month (being the day before the next rental payment is due) as detailed in Clause 1.3 of Core Terms.",,,

The tenant(s) must them make a further 12 months’ advance payment of £11,861.10 no later than the 10th month of the tenancy, for the remainder of the tenancy period. At the end of this tenancy should the tenant(s) seek a New Agreement and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to pay for further referencing to determine whether they can pay monthly in advance for the new term or whether as a result of the referencing the Landlord shall require payment in advance for the whole term. In either case the tenant(s) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents’ instructions with regard to payment and to make such payment promptly and in line with the provisions of this Agreement.

The landlord agrees Aysha will pay monthly at a rent amount of £955 - £36.78 (Aysha's portion of the rent credit) = £918.22 

The landlord agrees that the tenants should have a two weeks free rent incentive in total spread across 12 months {£73.46) will be reduced from the rent each month. Aysha = £36.78 monthly & Manahil's portion will be deducted in one deduction @ £441.36 from her 12 Month Rent In Advance Payment.

This overrides the payment schedule at the end of this agreement",,,
