For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000007Bnz7IAC,4.18538E+11,Succeeded,800Nz000007v5QMIAY,Updated,

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000007x9srIAA,4.18537E+11,Succeeded,800Nz000008ePkmIAE,Updated,

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000000mDe9IAE,4.18537E+11,Succeeded,800Nz0000013XIKIA2,Updated,

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000001bVKUIA2,4.18537E+11,Succeeded,800Nz000001qGUpIAM,Updated,

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

In either case the tenant(s) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents’ instructions with regard to payment and to make such payment promptly and in line with the provisions of this Agreement.

The landlord agrees Aysha will pay monthly at a rent amount of £955 - £36.78 (Aysha's portion of the rent credit) = £918.22

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,0068d00000BHzusAAD,4.18538E+11,Succeeded,8008d000000YT47AAG,Updated,

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000000Yu4cIAC,4.18537E+11,Succeeded,800Nz000000lxT1IAI,Updated,

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.
