For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

The tenant(s) must them make a further 12 months’ advance payment of £11,861.10 no later than the 10th month of the tenancy, for the remainder of the tenancy period. At the end of this tenancy should the tenant(s) seek a New Agreement and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to pay for further referencing to determine whether they can pay monthly in advance for the new term or whether as a result of the referencing the Landlord shall require payment in advance for the whole term. In either case the tenant(s) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents’ instructions with regard to payment and to make such payment promptly and in line with the provisions of this Agreement.

The landlord agrees Aysha will pay monthly at a rent amount of £955 - £36.78 (Aysha's portion of the rent credit) = £918.22 

The landlord agrees that the tenants should have a two weeks free rent incentive in total spread across 12 months {£73.46) will be reduced from the rent each month. Aysha = £36.78 monthly & Manahil's portion will be deducted in one deduction @ £441.36 from her 12 Month Rent In Advance Payment.

This overrides the payment schedule at the end of this agreement",,,
