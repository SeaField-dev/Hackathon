For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Thames Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly installments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Thames Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Thames Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property

11.2 Smoking

You, your family, guests and visitors must not smoke any substance or use electronic cigarettes inside or in the vicinity of the premises or the building, including on any balcony or in any communal spaces and in the event that damage is caused to the premises or the building as a result of a breach of this clause of the agreement, you agree to pay the costs incurred by us, in repairing that damage or redecorating the premises or building or have a sum equal to those costs deducted from the deposit

11.3 Tenant Break Clause

The Landlord agrees that the Tenant has the right to terminate the Tenancy after the first SIX (6) months by giving the Landlord not less than TWO (2) months PRIOR notice in writing. For the avoidance of doubt between the parties it is agreed that the notice period cannot expire any earlier than 6 months from the start date of the Lease as detailed in Clause 1.3 of Core Terms

11.4 Rent in Advance

Further to Section 1, Clauses 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and1.8 of this Lease it is further agreed that Mr Taylan Aygun shall pay their rent amount as detailed in the Initial Statement of Monies for initial first 6 months of this Lease in one sum of £11,439.96 payable in advance on the signing of this Lease. The tenant (s) must then make a further 6 months’ advance payment of £11,439.96 no later than the 04/11/2021 for the remainder of the lease. At the end of this Lease should the tenant(s) seek a New Lease and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to pay for further referencing to determine whether they can pay monthly in advance for the new term or whether as a result of the referencing the Landlord shall require payment in advance for the whole term.

These sums shall be paid on or before the 20/02/2023 and 20/06/2023 and not on the first of the month as expressed in Clause B5. At the end of this tenancy should the tenant(s) seek a New Agreement and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to pay for further referencing to determine whether they can pay monthly in advance for the new term or whether as a result of the referencing the Landlord shall require payment in advance for the whole term.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000002rNDTIA2,418538031006

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.


The new charges are out for April 21 new charge of £18.62 to be implemented for all flats at St Anne’s House and flats 1 to and including flat 21 St Anne’s Court.",,,,006Nz00000AVRnlIAH,418538022007

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz00000AiYEkIAN,418538023006

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz00000B6H34IAF,418538043005

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.


The new charges are out for April 21 new charge of £16.41 to be implemented for all flats at St Anne’s House and flats 1 to and including flat 21 St Anne’s Court.",,,,006Nz000000afz9IAA,418537012008

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000000bJq5IAE,418538010005

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000000bXgAIAU,418538020005

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000000mDe9IAE,418537009009

Further to Section B, Clauses 5 and 6 of this Agreement it is further agreed that Mr Bradley Cole shall pay a shortfall of £400.00 rent in advance as detailed in the Initial Statement of Monies in order to pass referencing. This means that the tenant(s) will then be expected to pay a total of £744.00 rent per calendar month for the remainder of the full 11 monthly payments in contractual term of their tenancy (the deduction has not been applied to the apportionments at the beginning and end of the tenancy, therefore £400 has been divided by 11). At the end of this tenancy should the tenant(s) seek a New Agreement, and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to undergo further referencing to determine whether they are required to make any advance payment of rent for the new term. In either case the tenant(s) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents’ instructions with regard to payment and n to make such payment promptly and in line with the provisions of this Agreement.",,,,006Nz000000fXrGIAU,222520006003

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000001AYXhIAO,418538038008

For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000001AXNBIA4,418538018008

At the end of this tenancy should tenant (tenant name) seek a New Agreement and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant agrees to pay for further referencing to determine whether they can pay monthly in advance for the new term whether as a result of the referencing the Landlord shall require them to pay in advance for whole term. In either case the tenant (tenant name) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents` instructions with regard payment and to make such payment promptly and inline with the provisions of this Agreement

           

It further agreed that Uthmaan Ali will pay their rent monthly via direct debit on the 1st of each month.",,,,006Nz000000VFnaIAG,222666233001

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000001Bgt3IAC,418537005008

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz000002rNDTIA2,418538031006

Further to Section B, Clauses 5 and 6 of this Agreement it is further agreed that the tenant shall pay their rent amount for the initial first 6 months of this Agreement in one sum of £9,000 payable in advance on the signing of this agreement. The tenant(s) must them make a further 6 months’ advance payment of £9,000 no later than the 14/05/2024, then at the 10th month (14/11/2024), at month 16 (14/05/2025), at month 22 (14/11/2025) and finally at month 28 (14/05/2026).

Further to Section B, Clauses 5 and 6 of this Agreement it is further agreed that Mr
Abdelsalam Gaddafi shall pay £1056 rent amount in advance as means of shortfall, in
order to pass referencing. This means that the tenant(s) will then be expected to pay a
total of £1047.00 rent per calendar month for the remainder of the contractual term of their
tenancy. At the end of this tenancy should the tenant(s) seek a New Agreement, and
should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to undergo further referencing to
determine whether they are required to make any advance payment of rent for the new
term. In either case the tenant(s) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents’
instructions with regard to payment and to make such payment promptly and in line with
the provisions of this Agreement.",,,,006Nz000004dhSeIAI,222578093002

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,006Nz00000BEnKHIA1,418538007006

Such annual sum is to be split into monthly installments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease.

We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Thames Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Thames Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property

If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Thames Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property

Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,,0068d00000BHzusAAD,418538042008

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises.

We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.
