If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Thames Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property
