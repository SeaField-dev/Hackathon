For any Premises without a separate or individual electricity meter, you agree to pay a reasonable proportion of the total charge as shall be determined by us. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the electricity charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you",,,

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,

Further to Section B, Clauses 5 and 6 of this Agreement it is further agreed that Miss Victoria Penney shall pay £1,679 rent amount in advance as detailed in the Initial Statement of Monies as means of shortfall, in order to pass referencing. This means that the tenant(s) will then be expected to pay a total of £600.08 rent per calendar month for the remainder of the contractual term of their tenancy. At the end of this tenancy should the tenant(s) seek a New Agreement, and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to undergo further referencing to determine whether they are required to make any advance payment of rent for the new term. In either case the tenant(s) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents’ instructions with regard to payment and to make such payment promptly and in line with the provisions of this Agreement.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,

Further to Section B, Clauses 5 and 6 of this Agreement it is further agreed that Mr Bradley Cole shall pay a shortfall of £400.00 rent in advance as detailed in the Initial Statement of Monies in order to pass referencing. This means that the tenant(s) will then be expected to pay a total of £744.00 rent per calendar month for the remainder of the full 11 monthly payments in contractual term of their tenancy (the deduction has not been applied to the apportionments at the beginning and end of the tenancy, therefore £400 has been divided by 11). At the end of this tenancy should the tenant(s) seek a New Agreement, and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to undergo further referencing to determine whether they are required to make any advance payment of rent for the new term. In either case the tenant(s) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents’ instructions with regard to payment and n to make such payment promptly and in line with the provisions of this Agreement.",,,

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,
