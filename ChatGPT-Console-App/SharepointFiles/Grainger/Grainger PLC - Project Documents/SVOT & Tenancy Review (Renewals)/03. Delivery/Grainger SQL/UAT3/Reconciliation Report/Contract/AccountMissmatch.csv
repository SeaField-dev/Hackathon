At the end of this Lease should the tenant(s) seek a New Lease and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to pay for further referencing to determine whether they can pay monthly in advance for the new term or whether as a result of the referencing the Landlord shall require payment in advance for the whole term.

Clause 11: Further to Section 1, Clauses 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and1.8 of this Lease it is further agreed that Miss Sacha Wright and Ms Julia Whalen shall pay their rent amount as detailed in the Initial Statement of Monies for initial first 6 months of this Lease in one sum of ¬£10,800 payable in advance on the signing of this Lease. The tenant (s) must then make a further 6 months‚Äô advance payment of ¬£10,800 no later than the (4 months of the lease) for the remainder of the lease. At the end of this Lease should the tenant(s) seek a New Lease and should the Landlord agree to this, the tenant(s) agree to pay for further referencing to determine whether they can pay monthly in advance for the new term or whether as a result of the referencing the Landlord shall require payment in advance for the whole term. In either case the tenant(s) undertakes to comply with the Landlord or his agents‚Äô instructions with regard to payment and to make such payment promptly and in line with the provisions of this Lease.


Where tenants are paying their rent monthly via direct debit, the rent will be collected on the day of the month that the tenancy commenced upon, not the 1st of each month.  This supersedes the provisions of clause B5 of the tenancy agreement and the payment schedule.‚Äù",,,

Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease.

We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you.

For any Premises without a separate or individual water meter, you agree to pay such amount as is specified by the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge as is relevant for the size of the Premises. Such annual sum is to be split into monthly instalments and paid during the tenancy term by the same method and on the same dates as the Rent is paid under the terms of this Lease. For the avoidance of doubt, this sum is an amount which must be paid in addition to the Rent. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the payments required under this clause in the event that there are any changes to the Southern Water Assessed Household Charge. If we decide to do this, we will serve you with 30 days written notice of our decision and you agree to pay the new amount from the next date upon which the rent is due after 30 days written notice has been served upon you. In the event that the Southern Water Assessed Water Household Charge ceases to exist, the parties will seek to agree an alternative means to settle water charges at the property.",,,
