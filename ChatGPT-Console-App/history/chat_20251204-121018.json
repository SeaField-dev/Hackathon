    "content": "Got it, Matt. I\u2019ll walk you through getting a Windows laptop set up for work at Open Box Software. I\u2019ll keep it practical and you can tell me where you\u2019re stuck.\n\nFirst, I need to know your situation:\n\n1. Are you:\n   - Setting up a **brand-new** laptop (first-time Windows setup)?\n   - Or **reinstalling**/resetting Windows on an existing laptop?\n\n2. Do you:\n   - Already have a **Windows license** from work (product key or pre-activated laptop)?\n   - Or is this a **BYOD** (your own laptop) that needs a fresh Windows install?\n\n3. Does Open Box use:\n   - **Microsoft 365 / Office 365** accounts (e.g. yourname@openboxsoftware.com)?\n   - Any known tools you\u2019ve been told to install (VS Code, Visual Studio, Docker, VPN, etc.)?\n\nIf you answer those, I can give you step-by-step instructions tailored to you.  \n\n---\n\nIn the meantime, here\u2019s the general setup path:\n\n### 1. Initial Windows setup (out-of-box)\n\nWhen you turn on the laptop for the first time:\n\n1. Choose your **language**, **region**, and **keyboard layout**.\n2. Connect to **Wi\u2011Fi**.\n3. When prompted to sign in:\n   - If you have a company Microsoft account (e.g. matt@openboxsoftware.com), choose:\n     - **Sign in with Microsoft / Work or school account**\n   - Otherwise choose **Set up for personal use** for now (we can connect work later).\n4. Create a **local PIN** when asked.\n5. Decline or adjust:\n   - Advertising / privacy options (you can turn most off).\n   - OneDrive / backup choices depending on company policy.\n\n### 2. Activation & Updates\n\n1. **Activate Windows**\n   - Go to: `Start > Settings > System > Activation`\n   - If it\u2019s not activated and you have a key, click **Change product key** and enter it.\n\n2. **Run Windows Update**\n   - `Start > Settings > Windows Update`\n   - Click **Check for updates** repeatedly until there are no more.\n   - Restart as many times as it asks.\n\n### 3. Join work account / organization\n\nIf Open Box uses Microsoft 365 / Azure AD:\n\n1. `Start > Settings > Accounts > Access work or school`\n2. Click **Connect**\n3. Sign in with your work email.\n4. Accept any device management prompts (Intune / MDM), if your company uses them.\n\nThis may auto-install some company-required apps or settings.\n\n### 4. Basic work tools (generic list)\n\nCommon dev tools (we can refine once you say what you need):\n\n- **Browser**:  \n  - Install Chrome or Firefox (if you don\u2019t want to stay on Edge).\n- **Editors / IDEs**:\n  - VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com\n  - Visual Studio (if .NET): https://visualstudio.microsoft.com\n- **Version control**:\n  - Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win\n  - Sign in with GitHub / Azure DevOps if used at Open Box.\n- **Communication**:\n  - Microsoft Teams / Slack / Zoom depending on what Open Box uses.\n- **VPN / Remote access**:\n  - Install the VPN client your company uses (Cisco AnyConnect, FortiClient, etc.).\n- **Package managers** (optional but useful):\n  - Winget (built into newer Windows), or\n  - Chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org (for scripted installs).\n\n### 5. Developer-specific setup\n\nThis depends on what you do at Open Box (web, .NET, Java, data, etc.). Once you tell me your:\n\n- Role (e.g. .NET dev, frontend, QA, BA)\n- Tech stack you use (or were told you\u2019ll use)\n\nI\u2019ll give you an exact list of tools and commands to get your machine fully ready, including:\n\n- Runtimes/SDKs (e.g. .NET, Node, Java)\n- Databases (SQL Server, Postgres, etc.)\n- Docker (if used)\n- Any environment variables or standard folder structure\n\n---\n\nReply with:\n\n1. New or existing laptop?\n2. Personal or company-provided machine?\n3. Your role / tech stack at Open Box (if you know it)?\n4. Where exactly you\u2019re stuck right now (e.g. \u201cfirst boot\u201d, \u201cjoining organization\u201d, \u201cVPN\u201d, \u201cinstalling dev tools\u201d)?\n\nI\u2019ll then give you a focused, step-by-step guide."
