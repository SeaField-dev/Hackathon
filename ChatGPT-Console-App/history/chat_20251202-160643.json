When the dog does the desired behavior, you click, then reward.\n   - The click precisely marks the moment they did the right thing.\n\n3. **Lure-and-Reward**\n   - Use a treat to *guide* the dog into position, then reward.\n   - Example: Hold a treat above the dog\u2019s nose and move it back over their head \u2192 dog\u2019s rear goes down \u2192 \u201cSit\u201d + reward.\n   - Over time, fade the lure and use only the word/hand signal.\n\n4. **Shaping**\n   - Reward small steps toward a final behavior.\n   - Example for \u201croll over\u201d:\n     - Dog lies down \u2192 reward.\n     - Dog turns head to side \u2192 reward.\n     - Dog rolls partially \u2192 reward.\n     - Dog rolls fully \u2192 big reward.\n   - Builds complex behaviors gradually.\n\n5. **Capturing**\n   - Wait for the dog to do a behavior naturally, then name and reward it.\n   - Example: Dog lies down on their own \u2192 say \u201cDown\u201d and give a treat \u2192 repeat until they connect the cue with the action.\n\n6. **Negative Punishment (removing something good)**\n   - Not hitting or scaring\u2014just removing a reward when behavior is unwanted.\n   - Example: Dog jumps for attention \u2192 you turn away and don\u2019t touch or talk.\n   - Dog learns \u201cJumping makes attention go away.\u201d\n\n7. **What good training usually includes**\n   - **Consistency**: Same cue, same rules, every time.\n   - **Short sessions**: 3\u201310 minutes, several times a day.\n   - **Clear cues**: One word per behavior (\u201cSit,\u201d \u201cDown,\u201d \u201cStay\u201d).\n   - **Timing**: Reward or mark (with \u201cYes!\u201d or a click) within 1\u20132 seconds.\n   - **Gradual difficulty**: Start in a quiet room, then add distractions, new places, longer durations.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- the age of the dog,\n- what you want to teach (e.g., sit, come, potty training, stop pulling),\nI can give a specific step\u2011by\u2011step plan."

    "content": "You train a corgi the same general way as any dog, but with a few corgi\u2011specific tweaks (they\u2019re smart, stubborn, and food\u2011motivated).\n\nI\u2019ll give you:\n1. Core rules for training a corgi  \n2. Step\u2011by\u2011step for basic commands  \n3. Big issues corgi owners usually face  \n\nIf you tell me your corgi\u2019s **age** and **main problems/goals**, I can tailor this.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core rules for training a corgi\n\n**Use positive reinforcement**\n- Tiny treats, praise, or a favorite toy.\n- Mark the behavior with a quick word like **\u201cYes!\u201d** the moment they do it, then reward.\n\n**Short, frequent sessions**\n- 3\u20135 minutes, 3\u20136 times per day.\n- Corgis get bored and stubborn if drilled too long.\n\n**Be very consistent**\n- Same word, same hand signal, same rule every time.\n- Everyone in the house must follow the same rules.\n\n**Manage food motivation**\n- Great for training, but they gain weight easily.\n- Use **very small treats** (pea\u2011sized) and count them as part of their daily food.\n\n**Exercise first, train second**\n- A quick walk or play session before training helps them focus.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Step\u2011by\u2011step: Basic commands\n\n### A. \u201cSit\u201d\n1. Hold a treat to your corgi\u2019s nose.\n2. Slowly move it up and back over the head.\n3. As the butt hits the floor: say **\u201cSit\u201d \u2192 \u201cYes!\u201d \u2192 treat**.\n4. Repeat 10\u201315 times over a couple of days.\n5. Then ask for **\u201cSit\u201d** *before* showing the treat.\n6. Fade the treat in your hand; reward from your pocket sometimes.\n\n---\n\n### B. \u201cDown\u201d\n1. Start with your corgi **sitting**.\n2. Put a treat at the nose, then move it straight down to the floor between the paws.\n3. When elbows hit the ground: **\u201cDown\u201d \u2192 \u201cYes!\u201d \u2192 treat**.\n4. If they stand up, reset and try again closer to their chest.\n5. Over time, say **\u201cDown\u201d** first, then use a smaller hand signal.\n\n---\n\n### C. \u201cCome\u201d (recall)\nDo this indoors or in a fenced area first.\n\n1. Get low, open your arms, use a happy voice: **\u201c[Name], come!\u201d**\n2. When they move toward you: **\u201cYes!\u201d** and give several treats + praise.\n3. Let them go again (so \u201ccome\u201d doesn\u2019t always end fun).\n4. Practice at short distances, then gradually farther.\n5. Only use **\u201ccome\u201d** for good things at first\u2014**don\u2019t** use it to call them for punishment or something they hate (like nail trims).\n\n---\n\n### D. Loose-leash walking (corgis love to pull)\n1. Use a **harness** (better for their long backs) and a regular 4\u20136 ft leash.\n2. Start in a low-distraction place (hallway, yard).\n3. Treat your corgi for being at your side and the leash staying loose.\n   - One step with a loose leash \u2192 \u201cYes!\u201d \u2192 treat.\n4. If they pull:\n   - Stop walking.\n   - Wait for the leash to loosen or for them to look back at you.\n   - Then move forward again and reward walking by your side.\n5. Repeat: **Pulling never moves them forward; walking nicely does.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common corgi issues & how to handle them\n\n### A. Barking\nCorgis were bred to herd and alert, so they bark.\n\n**Teach \u201cQuiet\u201d:**\n1. Wait for a bark.\n2. Say **\u201cQuiet\u201d**, then show a treat to their nose.\n3. When they stop barking to sniff: **\u201cYes!\u201d \u2192 treat**.\n4. Practice until they start to associate \u201cQuiet\u201d with closing their mouth.\n5. Reward any moment of calm when something exciting is happening (doorbell, people passing).\n\nAlso:\n- Make sure they get **enough physical + mental exercise** (puzzle toys, training games).\n- Avoid yelling; it often makes them bark more.\n\n---\n\n### B. Herding / nibbling at heels\nVery corgi.\n\n1. If they nip or chase your feet:\n   - Immediately **stop moving** and stand still.\n   - No talking, no pushing them away.\n2. When they stop and look up: **\u201cYes!\u201d \u2192 treat or praise**.\n3. Redirect them to:\n   - A toy to chase.\n   - A command like **\u201cSit\u201d** or **\u201cDown\u201d** for reward.\n4. Don\u2019t play chasing games that reward them for going after your legs.\n\n---\n\n### C. Stubbornness\nCorgis are smart enough to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d\n\n- Keep **rewards high-value** when teaching new things (chicken, cheese, tiny bits).\n- Make training a **game**, not a chore\u2014lots of quick rewards, upbeat tone.\n- If they \u201cignore\u201d a cue, ask:\n  - Is the environment too distracting?\n  - Am I rewarding enough?\n  - Did I teach it clearly in easier situations first?\n\n---\n\n### D. Back & weight care (important for training)\n- Avoid a lot of **jumping off furniture**, stairs running, or rough impact.\n- Keep them **lean**. You should feel ribs easily under a thin fat layer.\n- Use **very small** food rewards; you can use part of their regular kibble.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- How old your corgi is  \n- What they already know  \n- What\u2019s hardest right now (e.g., barking, pulling, potty training, biting, not listening)\n\nI can write a specific 1\u20132 week training plan for you."
